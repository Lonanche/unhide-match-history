# GeoGuessr Unhide Match History

A userscript that displays ranked duel history on all GeoGuessr user profiles, even when users have hidden their match history.

## Installation

**[Click here to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lonanche/unhide-match-history/main/unhide-match-history.user.js)**

You'll need a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) installed first.

## Why?

Match history should be public so players cannot hide evidence of win trading, cheating, or other suspicious behavior. This script ensures transparency in the competitive GeoGuessr community.
